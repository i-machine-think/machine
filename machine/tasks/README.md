Datasets for compositional learning

This repository contains several datasets used to evaluate to what extent a system has learned a compositional or systematic solution. Currenty, it contains three tasks.

## SCAN

A dataset proposed in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00350) of mapping simple input instructions to an output sequence, designed to evaluate to what extent a network learns a systematic solution.

## Lookup-tables

A dataset proposed in [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06467) to evaluate compositional learning.

## Symbol-rewriting

A dataset proposed in [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01445) to evaluate a model's ability to generalise on a simple symbol rewriting task.
